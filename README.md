# Lambda Conversation Module
A addon for Lambda Players that allows Lambda Players to have conversations with other Lambdas and Real Players. One of the returning features from Zeta Players

This conversation system unlike the Zeta's, can support more than Lambdas/Players in a conversation. This means conversations are no longer limited to 1 on 1


This module will add two new voice types for
`conrespond | Voice lines that are used when a Lambda "asks a question"`
`conquestion | Voice lines that are used when a Lambda "responds to a question"`
