# Lambda Conversation Module
Note: This fork will rewrite the current code to allow multiple lambda's to join in on conversations, as they currently can only join in when a Human Player is present.

Added Support for [xdR: The Simpsons Hit and Run Dialogue Animations [Playermodel Anims]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3213611699)

A addon for Lambda Players that allows Lambda Players to have conversations with other Lambdas and Real Players. One of the returning features from Zeta Players

This conversation system unlike the Zeta's, can support more than Lambdas/Players in a conversation. This means conversations are no longer limited to 1 on 1


This module will add two new voice types for use in Voice Profiles and ect

`conrespond | Voice lines that are used when a Lambda "asks a question"`

`conquestion | Voice lines that are used when a Lambda "responds to a question"`
